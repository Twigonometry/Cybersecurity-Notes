# Useful Resources
A compilation of some of my favourite Cybsersecurity Resources - tools, articles, practice platforms, learning materials, and more.

This list is based on a version that I helped to build for [Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers](https://shefesh.com) society. You can find the original list here: [https://shefesh.com/wiki/resources](https://shefesh.com/wiki/resources)

I converted the HTML code to markdown using [Turndown](https://domchristie.github.io/turndown/). Thanks for making my life easy!
