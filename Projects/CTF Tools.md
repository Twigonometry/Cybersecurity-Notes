# CTF Tools
This repository is a collection of tools to be used in CTFs and hacking practice such as Hack the Box.

The tools are not necessarily optimised. Many of them are rebuilds of common tools for the purpose of learning.

## Scripts

This folder contains various scripts for... various things

**Simple Python Server**

This is a fork of another server gist, tweaked to support POST requests.

**Juice Shop**

[This folder](https://github.com/Twigonometry/CTF-Tools/tree/master/scripts/juice-shop) contains a number of payloads for OWASP Juice Shop, which we covered in SESH sessions in September-October 2020.

## Hack the Box

[This folder](https://github.com/Twigonometry/CTF-Tools/tree/master/hack_the_box) contains a number of scripts that I've used in Hack the Box.

I make commits locally and then push them up when the box retires. Commits may be dated before the box retired, but will not be published publicly until that date.
