I did this box back in December 2020. It was the fifth box I'd done, and only the second medium-rated box I'd tried. It took me a few days of pretty non-stop work to get User, and I had Root after a week.

I wasn't as good at taking screenshots for my notes back then, so when I converted this writeup to Obsidian I made sure to go back and get some. Therefore you may see some screenshots dated after the box retired. My IP might also change between bash commands :)

This is also my first writeup of a HTB box. It is also available [on my website](https://www.mac-goodwin.com/blog/htb/2021/04/29/htb-bucket.html), where the pages are in one sprawling post if you prefer that to notes that sexily link together.

I'm still working out my personal style for writeups, and this one has turned out to be quite long. I enjoy writing up my thought processes and making my writeups quite detailed - mostly because, primarily, these are resources for me.

Some people might not like this style, and that is fine - snappier text writeups are available, such as those by [0xdf](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/). But if you like a bit of explanation and a narrative style, as well as seeing where people go wrong, these might be for you. I think there is a benefit to including mistakes in writeups, so we can learn from them going forwards.

This box was extremely fun. The initial exploit involved enumerating a webserver to discover it was linked to some AWS resources. There were then two parallel parts: interacting with a DynamoDB shell to exfiltrate some credentials, and uploading a web shell to an S3 bucket for code execution on the box.

Once you were on the box, you could use the stolen credentials to log in as the user `roy`. roy had access to a locally-hosted web app which you could access via SSH tunneling and exploit by adding a malicious entry in a database that caused the web app to read a sensitive file and convert it to a PDF.

## Ratings

I rated user a 6 for difficulty at the time, as I found the debugging of the DDB code very difficult. After revisiting the box I would probably rate it a 5, as the steps were fairly simple but just required some knowledge of AWS.

I rated root a 7 for difficulty. It involved some techniques I hadn't used before, such as SSH tunneling, and a cool custom exploitation on a web app, plus an interesting way of stealing a sensitive file via a PDF attachment which I hadn't seen before.
