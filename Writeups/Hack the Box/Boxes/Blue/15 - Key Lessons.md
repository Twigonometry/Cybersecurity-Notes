# Key Lessons

Here are some of the key things I learned on this box:
- Basic enumeration of SMB servers with `smbmap`
- Null authentication, and authentication with specific named guest accounts
- Use of the nmap `--script vuln` flag to scan for vulnerabilities
- Important skills running Python scripts written in different versions of Python, and installing packets for specific Python versions
- Enumeration of named pipes using the Metasploit `auxiliary/scanner/smb/pipe_auditor` module
- Generation of shellcode for windows platforms with `msfvenom`
- Configuration of the Eternal Blue exploit to match the specific named pipes and SMB login credentials for a target machine

Although this is the easiest box on Hack the Box, it taught me an awful lot!
