# Enumeration

## nmap

I started off with an `nmap` scan:

This shows a large number of RPC ports, and an SMB service on port 445.

OS Discovery reveals the operating system to be `Windows 7 Professional 7601`, and reveals a potential user `haris`

## Enumerating SMB

I tried a basic `smbmap` against the host to see if any domain name was exposed, then tried enumerating with null authentication:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ smbmap -H 10.10.10.40
[+] IP: 10.10.10.40:445	Name: 10.10.10.40
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ smbmap -u null -p "" -H 10.10.10.40
[+] Guest session   	IP: 10.10.10.40:445	Name: 10.10.10.40                                       
        Disk                                                  	Permissions	Comment
	----                                                  	-----------	-------
	ADMIN$                                            	NO ACCESS	Remote Admin
	C$                                                	NO ACCESS	Default share
	IPC$                                              	NO ACCESS	Remote IPC
	Share                                             	READ ONLY	
	Users                                             	READ ONLY
```

We can see we have access to the `Share` share and the `Users` share. Let's connect to them and see what's inside:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ smbclient //10.10.10.40/Users
Enter WORKGROUP\mac's password:

```

The `Users` share is particularly interesting, and contains some `NTUSER.DAT` files. These are Windows Profile files, and it seems it is potentially possible to [extract password information](https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/18.html) from them. We'll make a note of this and potentially come back to these later if we run out of ideas.

### SMB Vulnerability Scan

I didn't do this when I first ran through the box, but the following command would have immediately raised that the box was vulnerable to Eternal Blue.

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/Personal-Vault]

I found out it was vulnerable a different way, detailed in the next section.
