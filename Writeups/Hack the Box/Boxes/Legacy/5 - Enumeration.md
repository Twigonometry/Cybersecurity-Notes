# Enumeration
## nmap

I started out with the standard `nmap` scan, using `-Pn` to not send ping probes:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/legacy]
└─$ nmap -v -sC -sV -Pn -oA nmap/ 10.10.10.4
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

This reveals the box name to be `LEGACY` and the Operating System to be Windows XP. The only ports open are 139 for `netbios` and 445 for `SMB`.

While this was running, in another pane I started a full port scan with a `sleep 300` so it would start after five minutes:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/legacy]
└─$ nmap -Pn -p- -oA nmap/all-ports 10.10.10.4
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

3389/tcp closed ms-wbt-server

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 118.06 seconds
```

There were no new ports.

As this was an old operating system and port 445 was open, I ran a `vuln` nmap scan to check if the system was vulnerable to [[CVE-2017-0143|Eternal Blue]]:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/legacy]
└─$ nmap -Pn --script vuln 10.10.10.4 -p 445
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

Sure enough, it was!
