# Overview

This is the second box in my OSCP prep series.

**Box Details**

This box was also super simple. It involved exploiting Eternal Blue on an old Windows XP machine. The only difference between it and [[Blue Index|Blue]] was the operating system and SMB username. I had rooted it within 40 minutes, and a good chunk of that time was spent documenting the process.

## Ratings

I rated both user and root a 1 for difficulty. The exploit was incredibly simple, and there was no privesc involved.
