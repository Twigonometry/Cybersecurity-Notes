# Key Lessons
Here are some of the key things I learned from this box
- Try every tool! There may be multiple exploits available - go for the most recent one first, and don't give up if one doesn't work
- Using `wget` as an alternative download method when powershell is being fiddly
- Bear in mind what *kind* of shell you're in - it may be powershell, not command prompt, which will change the syntax of the commands you're running
