# Enumeration

## Nmap

I started with an `nmap` scan:


```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/shocker]
└─$ nmap -sC -sV -v -Pn -oA nmap/shocker 10.10.10.56

```

Key findings:
- webserver running on port 80, with Apache 2.4.18
- SSH running on non-standard port 2222
- Ubuntu box

### All ports

I also did a full port scan:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/shocker]
└─$ sleep 300; nmap -p- -Pn -oA nmap/shocker-allports 10.10.10.56
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

80/tcp   open  http
2222/tcp open  EtherNetIP-1

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.52 seconds
```

### UDP

And a UDP scan:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/shocker]
└─$ sudo nmap -sU -Pn -oA nmap/shocker-udp 10.10.10.56
[sudo] password for mac:

All 1000 scanned ports on 10.10.10.56 are closed

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1006.91 seconds
```

## Vuln Checks

I ran `nmap`'s `vuln` script to see if there were any quick wins:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/shocker]
└─$ nmap --script vuln -Pn -oA nmap/shocker-vuln 10.10.10.56
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-06-14 08:27 BST

Host is up (0.043s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE

|   Slowloris DOS attack
|     State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.

2222/tcp open  EtherNetIP-1

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 323.34 seconds
```

The vuln check identified port 2222 as running EtherNetIP-1, not SSH, so I ran a quick searchsploit:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/shocker]
└─$ searchsploit ethernetip
Exploits: No Results
Shellcodes: No Results
Papers: No Results
```

But it found nothing.

## Gobuster

I ran a `gobuster` scan on the site:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/shocker]

```

It found nothing - I would end up having to do a few extra `gobuster` scans later on.

## Autorecon

I also launched an autorecon scan after spending some time manually enumerating the webserver and finding nothing, just in case I'd missed something obvious:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/shocker]
└─$ autorecon 10.10.10.56
```

It didn't find any new services. I checked out the `nikto` and `whatweb` scans to see if they raised any new vulnerabilities that I hadn't seen:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/shocker/results/10.10.10.56/scans]
└─$ cat tcp_80_http_nikto.txt
